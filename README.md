## Safety Helmet Detection with YOLOv10 Colab Notebook

This Colab notebook demonstrates safety helmet detection in real-time using a pre-trained YOLOv10 model. The model is  trained on a dataset named "Safety_Helmet_Dataset.zip"

**Features:**

-   **Real-time safety helmet detection:** The notebook identifies and visualizes helmets worn by people in a live video stream or uploaded images.
-   **YOLOv10 model:** Leverages a pre-trained YOLOv10 model for efficient object detection.
-   **Colab environment:** Provides a platform to run the code without local installation.

**Requirements:**

-   This Colab notebook (link to your notebook)
-   **Safety_Helmet_Dataset.zip:** The dataset used to train the YOLOv10 model 
-   Pre-trained YOLOv10 weights file  

**Setup:**
 (instructions in Colab).
